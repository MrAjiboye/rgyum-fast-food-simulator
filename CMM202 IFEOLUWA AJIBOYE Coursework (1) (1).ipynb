When this option is selected, the user should be prompted to input their username and password. The username should be *admin* and the password should be any number smaller than *10* (including float and negative numbers). You should allow the user to try *four* times, if all of them are incorrect, then the program stops and the program cell needs to be run again.\n","\n","  * Note: Once that an admin has logged in, this option has to be disabled (i.e. the user cannot go back and select this option).\n","\n","2. **Add products**: This option can only be accessed once option 1 has been completed, otherwise the message *login first!* should be displayed and the program should go back to the main menu. In this option, the admin will be shown the list of foods and categories in the fast-food menu. Then, the admin can input a menu number  to add *one more product* for that certain menu slot. Afterwards, the program should show the new foods and go back to the main menu.\n","  \n","  * Note: Keep in mind that each space in the fast-food menu can hold a maximum of *eight* products (of the same food, of course). Also, you cannot add products in the empty menu slots. Therefore, your program should warn the admin in case that they want to add more products of a specific food in a menu slot, or if the admin wants to add products in an empty slot.\n","\n","3. **Buy food**: This option can be accessed by \"anyone\", so there is no need for a validation. If this option is selected, the user will be shown the list of foods, amounts and prices. Then, the user will be requested to select one food item based on the `menu_number`. Once the food is selected, your program must display the price of the selected product. Then, the user will be prompted to pay. To simulate this payment, you will ask the user for an input and write any positive number (if the user inputs something invalid, ask to try again). Then, your program must check this number against the price of the product to be bought. If the input number is larger than the price, then you should return *your change is...* and the subtraction of the payment minus the price of the snack. If the number is equal to the price, then you must return *thanks for paying*. Else, you should output *you need to pay more* and allow the user to write another amount. After the \"purchase\", you should output to the user the number of products left for that particular food (therefore, you need to update the data frame!). Notice that if there were zero products left for the food selected, then you must prompt this to the user in advance before letting them buy, and ask them to select another food.\n","\n","4. **Exit**"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["## Use this cell to write your code\n","loop = True\n","admin_logged_in = False\n","max_attempts = 4\n","counter = 0\n","while loop == True and counter < max_attempts:\n","    print('Welcome to the RGyUm fast-food menu.
